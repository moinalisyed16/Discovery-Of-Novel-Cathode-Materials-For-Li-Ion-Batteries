# Discovery-Of-Novel-Cathode-Materials-For-Li-Ion-Batteries
Created an ML model to predict Li-ion cathode properties using a 170-entry dataset. Used HEXBIN and Partial Dependency Plots for insights, optimized via Grid Search, and achieved RÂ² of 0.86 with regression models. Contributed to efficient material discovery for advanced batteries.
